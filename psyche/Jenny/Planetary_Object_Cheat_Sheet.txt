Distance of each planet (in order) from one another:
•	Pluto’s distance from Neptune: roughly 17 astronomical units (AU) (note: AU = 149.6 million kilometers (the distance between earth and the sun)
•	Side notes on Psyche: It completes a rotation on its axis every 4.2 hours.
•	Psyche distance from closest planets: Psyche is located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It is 2.5 to 3.3 times further from the sun than the Earth. Because Psyche and Earth orbit at different speeds, the distance from Earth to Psyche varies from less than 186 million miles to more than 372 million miles. It is 1,900 to 2,700 miles (3,000 to 4,400 kilometers) from Mars.
•	Psyche’s distance from sun: 235 to 309 million miles (378 to 497 million kilometers) from the sun. (2.5 to 3.3 AU)
•	Neptune’s distance from Uranus: 1,015,078,293 miles (1,633,610,160 kilometers) (10.92 AU) 
•	Uranus’ distance from Saturn: 900,377,530 miles (1,448,950,000 kilometers)
•	Saturn’s distance from Jupiter: distance varies from 4.3 AU and 14.7 AU due to them constantly moving around the sun
•	Jupiter distance from Mars: 342,012,346 miles (550,390,000 kilometers)
•	Mars distance from Earth: 140 million miles (225 million kilometers)
•	Earth’s distance from Venus: 126,249,125 miles (203,178,272 kilometers)
•	Venus distance from Mercury: 58 million kilometers
